        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I’m <strong>Paulo Martinez-Amezaga</strong>, a first-year student at <strong>Northeastern University</strong> pursuing a 
          combined Bachelor of Science in <strong>Data Science and Biology</strong>. My academic and professional interests lie 
          at the intersection of technology, data, and the life sciences. I’m passionate about exploring how computational models 
          and artificial intelligence can transform how we understand biological systems, particularly in fields like bioinformatics, 
          genetics, and healthcare analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Northeastern, I’ve developed a foundation in both computer science and biology through courses such as Foundations of 
          Data Science, Organic Chemistry, and Genetics & Molecular Biology. Beyond academics, I’m involved with the <em>Society of 
          Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE)</em>, the <em>Latinx American Student Organization</em>, and <em>Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity</em>, 
          where I’ve built leadership and community engagement skills. My long-term goal is to merge my data-driven mindset with 
          biological insight to create technologies that improve health outcomes and scientific discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the classroom, I’m deeply curious about global innovation and love connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. 
          I’m especially interested in studying abroad to explore international research opportunities and gain cross-cultural perspectives 
          that will strengthen my understanding of science and society.
        </p>
