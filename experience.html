      <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
      <p>
        My journey as a developer and data scientist has allowed me to work across diverse industries—from education and technology 
        to healthcare and non-profit organizations. I’ve developed scalable backend systems, machine learning models, and visual 
        analytics tools that bridge the gap between data and decision-making.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sigma Beta Rho National Executive Board (Boston, MA)</strong> – Developed a custom CRM using Django, SQL, and Docker that centralized data for 70+ chapters nationwide, reducing management time by 75%.</li>
        <li><strong>AlizaSoft, Clínica Imbanaco (Cali, Colombia)</strong> – Designed and optimized a medical software database using Laravel and MySQL, cutting manual record-keeping by 70%.</li>
        <li><strong>Consensus Project</strong> – Built a machine learning-powered policy analysis platform using Flask, TensorFlow, and MySQL to simulate policy effects on employment and inequality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These experiences strengthened my skills in backend development, data analytics, and teamwork. I aim to continue leveraging 
        technology to design ethical, impactful solutions in bioinformatics and healthcare. My technical stack includes Python, R, 
        SQL, and frameworks like TensorFlow, Django, and Flask, along with visualization libraries like Plotly and Matplotlib.
